--| Fixes
 - Fixed an issue where the game would crash when given only one word as input like "use" without a item

--| Changes
 - Added functionality for two worded items like "gun barrel" or "rusty key"
 - Added Exit-Descriptions to Exit-Class
 - Changed Take-function. Now the player can attempt to take items with a text response without the item actually being picked up.
	exampke "take chest" -> "the chest is too heavy to be picked up"
